<!-- Do not use <b> rather use <strong> to make text bold -->

            If you <strong>crochet</strong>, then you are a <strong>crocheter</strong>.
            It does not matter how fast or how much.
            It does not matter if today is your first day,
            or if you have been crocheting for 20 years.
            There is no test to pass, no membership card
            to get. <strong>You just crochet</strong>.

            Just a <em>small business</em> that decided to go for it.
            I am too <em>legit to knit</em>.
            I also sell Yarn.
            Hit me up and let us make beautiful designs.
            I am in <strong><em>Nairobi, Kenya</em></strong>.

            Sometimes you need to unravel to find your purpose.
            Crocheting centers my chi and keeps me from unravelling.
            I stitch the stress away.
            If you are like me, then you can never have enough yarn.
            A lady never discusses the size of her yarn stash.
